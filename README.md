# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview:

##### Rideshare Data Analysis using Matplotlib and Pandas

Pyber, a python based ride sharing company wants some visual analysis of a large data set to show relationship between various cities and # of riders and drivers.

As analysts working for V. Isualize, I and Omar are tasked to creatie a summary DataFrame, a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type and summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

##### Dependencies - Python programming using Pandas library, Jupyter Notebook and charts created using Matplotlib.


## Results:

It was an interesting analysis and it helped uncover several data-points and trends.


- As can be seen in below summary, the total number of rides are highest in Urban areas and least in Rural areas. This should primarily be due to higher affordability of riders in urban areas or due to scarcity of drivers in rural areas. Probably the reason for highest fares in rural areas amongst all type of cities as well.

- Compared to average fares between each city type,  the average fares in the rural cities are highest almost 45% higher than Urban cities and ~10% higher than sub-urban cities

- Avg. number of drivers in urban cties at 37 drivers per city is ~9 times of rural cities and 2.6 times the suburban cities.
 
- the average fare for rides in the rural cities is about $11 and $5 more per ride than the urban and suburban cities, respectively.

From below chart it appears that the trend of fares charged across the year remains same in Rutral areas while some spike can be seen for Urban cities between mid-feb to mid-march.

## Recommendations:

- PyBer can look at tiered/differentiated pricing for Rural cities to expand their outreach

- They can also aim to provide incentives to drivers diverting to non-urban areas during non-peak months. This will give parity pricing as the supply of cabs will increase in non-uprban areas as well.
